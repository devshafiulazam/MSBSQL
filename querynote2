How to establish SQL self join
---------------------------

Self Join
----------
Applied when a table must join itself
* If you'd like to combine certain rows of a
table with other rows of the same table, you need a self join.

using aliases is obligatory

These references to the original table let you use different
blocks of the available data.

You can either filter both in the join, or you can filter one
of them in the WHERE clause, and the other one -in the join.

SELECT DISTINCT
e1.*
FROM
emp_manager e1
JOIN
emp_manager e2
ON
e1.emp_no = e2.manager_no;


SELECT DISTINCT
e1.*
FROM
emp_manager e1
JOIN
emp_manager e2
ON
e1.emp_no = e2.manager_no

WHERE
e2.emp_no IN(
SELECT 
manager_no
FROM
emp_manager);
